Description of the project outcome:
Over the course of the last couple months of the project, I made a few changes to my desired outcome for Third Eye Surveillance. 
The biggest change was/is that the raspberry pi 4 does not serve as the place to view the surveillance camera feed. I decided to do this for a number of reasons;
      Implementing the Motion software allows RPi Zero W camera to work perfectly well as an IP camera & IP cameras are not only super easy to access, 
      but they can also be accessed by as many devices (with web browsers) as a person could fit on a single wifi network.
      The RPi 4 with the touchscreen remains an important part in this surveillance project as it is still the device used to configure and 
      control the Motion software within the headless RPI Zero W.
      Using the Pi Zero W w/ Motionc as an IP camera allowed me to properly create a system that is wireless, which was a goal of mine from the start.
      
I am very happy with the outcome of this project, especially since I decided to scrap the idea of using only the Raspberry Pi 4 for accessing the surveillance feed.
