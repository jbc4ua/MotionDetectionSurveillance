Problem statement:
What “problem” does your project fix?
What if you wanted/needed your own, easy to use, motion-detecting surveillance system.
Who will benefit from your work and why?
Senior citizens who want/need to monitor places/things like doorways, yards, gardens, mailboxes, etc.
Background:
Why are you attempting this project?
I already possess multiple components that the project will require. Also, I want to do it cause I think it would be a cool educational experience.
What does an outsider need to know in order to understand your project and understand why it is important?
How surveillance cameras work, motion detection... the user interface should be pretty minimal, easy to use/intuitive.
Methodology:
How will you implement your project?
I will fabricate a enclosure for a raspberry pi + camera, implement software to connect my raspi4 & a raspi zero via wifi adaptor (the zero collects and sends the camera feed to the raspi4).
How will you achieve your desired outcome?
Good planning and staying on schedule. Making sure all my components are fully functional.
Desired outcome:
What would constitute a “successful” project?
The RPi4 successfully recieves camera feed transmitted from raspi0 wirelessly & motion detection software works.
What do you hope to achieve?
Have my own easy-to-use surveillance system.
